### AI

We will start with the `hello world` of machine learning, a `neural network` which predicts the output of a simple `XOR` gate.
Why XOR you ask? The reason is because the classes in XOR are not linearly separable. You cannot draw a straight line to separate the 
points (0,0),(1,1) from the points (0,1),(1,0), hence it's a perfect candidate for a simple AI project.

Our network has 3 layers: input, hidden and output. Each layer has 2 nodes. The output layer nodes display the probability of either 0 or 1
being chosen as the XOR result.
